# News App

## Things to note

1. This application uses the news api for all the data within.
2. This is a development application and meant for educational purposes.
3. You will need an API key from News API in order to access their data.
4. The API key is for development purposes only. If you plan to push this to production, then you will need to get a production API key from them as well.

## About the Application

1. Build in `reactjs`
2. Styled with `tailwindcss` because classnames are hard to come up with.
3. Still in development so there is no live demo.
4. Uses `axios` to fetch data because it is more secure than the fetch API.
5. `momentjs` to format the dates on the articles.
6. `react-icons` for icons in the application.
7. `react-router-dom` to handle our internal routing.

More information will be added as the application continues to come together.
